## 1. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is a way to propose changes from one branch to another (usually feature ‚Üí main). It allows for code review and discussion before merging.

## 2. Why Use Pull Requests?

* Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same codebase.
* Review: Team members can review and comment before merging.
* History: Keeps track of why changes were made.

## 3. Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your feature branch to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
3. Click on **"Compare & pull request"**.
4. Add a meaningful title and description.
5. Click **"Create pull request"**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your branch is up to date with the target branch to avoid conflicts.

## 4. Reviewing a Pull Request

* Click on the PR in GitHub.
* Use the **"Files changed"** tab to view diffs.
* Add comments inline.
* Approve or request changes.

```diff
+ Looks good to me
- Missing validation logic on this part
```

## 5. Merging a Pull Request

* Once approved, click **"Merge pull request"**.
* Choose one of the following:

  * **Create a merge commit** (default, preserves history)
  * **Squash and merge** (combine all commits into one)
  * **Rebase and merge** (apply commits one by one, cleaner history)

## 6. Best Practices

* Always create a new branch for every feature or fix.
* Keep PRs small and focused.
* Add screenshots or demo gifs for UI changes.
* Mention related issues with `Fixes #issue_number`.
* Use draft PRs to share WIP (Work in Progress).

## Final Notes

Pull requests are the core of collaboration on GitHub. Use them regularly to ensure clean, reviewed, and traceable code updates.
